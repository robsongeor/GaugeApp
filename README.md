# GaugeApp

This PyQt5 app is designed to work with the raspberry PI and MCP3208 chip to read sensor data.

Currently it takes four sensor inputs and graphs their data, aswell as gives a readout. Each sensor can also be turned on or off to select what sensors are displaying.

The MCP3208 is a 12bit ADC that can take 8 inputs and eventually I will make use of the other 4. 

Executing the mainApp.py will launch the app
The settings.py file is where users will be able to make changes to the app
